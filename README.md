# Chosen project 
The chosen task was the food recipes websites.

# Techs used
Front-end, as requested, was developed using angular.
For backend, I used NodeJS and Firebase to use a database.
To deploy the application, I used Google Cloud Platform and deployed the api and app container in 2 Kubernetes pods.

App-server: http://34.66.204.33/
NodeJS server: http://35.232.231.196:3000/api/recipes-book/

# To Do
Unfortunately I couldn't finished the front-end side for add recipes but added the code in the back-end server.

# More Info
Both app and api running instructions are inside the README's of each folder
